#OpenHosting

OpenHosting is a major modification of the official GHost++ source.
I recently starting remake the bot on a new base. Follow and track the bot here:
https://github.com/Grief-Code/ohbot_v2
Official releases will be still made on this repository, however there is still a main support for the current ghost. But it will become from time to time outdated.

---
#####Update:
I have decided to continue working on bot1, i have listed once down how many changes are required for having a normal bot moved to the OHSystem working field, and this is probably takin too much time.
However, I will create a module system for personal and closed source patches.
The bot will be still available and will be still maintained for public usages.

There will be also an update to make the installation process for newcomers a lot easier.
